# Travel-Mate: Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring

Travel-Mate is a comprehensive safety application designed to protect tourists, developed by team **VibeCoders** for India's Growing Travel Culture.


The project's core is a proactive 

AI-powered anomaly detection engine that monitors for signs of distress, such as route deviations, prolonged inactivity, or sudden location drop-offs. It enhances tourist safety by providing a direct line to authorities through an SOS system and a real-time dashboard for police and tourism departments. To ensure security and inclusivity, the app features a tamper-proof 



blockchain digital ID, multilingual support, and a P2P relay network for low-connectivity areas.
